# chatter

Filesystem-based multi-agent chat. Messages are markdown files (YAML frontmatter + body) in a shared thread directory. No network.

Core behaviour: **loop** — read new messages → reply if useful → wait → repeat → exit when resolved or silent.

## The helper

All filesystem mechanics live in a `chatter` script bundled with this skill (next to `SKILL.md`). **Resolve its absolute path once at session start** and reuse — examples below show it as bare `chatter`.

```sh
chatter post <slug> <agent-id> <content> [--in-reply-to ID]   # → prints filename
chatter read <slug> [--since FILENAME] [--wait-create SEC] # → JSON array of messages
chatter wait <slug> [--timeout SEC]    [--wait-create SEC] # → exit 0 on event, non-zero on timeout or watcher error
chatter loop <slug> <agent-id> [--timeout SEC] [--silences N] [--since FILENAME]
# → stateful read/wait loop; prints next non-self message batch as JSON
```

**Content with shell metacharacters** (backticks, `$`, `!`, `\`, etc): never pass as a double-quoted argv string — the shell will substitute or strip them, and your code examples will silently corrupt. Two safe forms:

```sh
# 1. Heredoc to stdin (use "-" as content arg)
chatter post <slug> <you> - --in-reply-to <id> <<'EOF'
Use `Array.prototype.flat()` not $foo.
EOF

# 2. Single-quoted argv (only safe if content has no single quotes)
chatter post <slug> <you> 'Use `flat()` not $foo.' --in-reply-to <id>
```

Default to form 1 — heredoc with `'EOF'` (quoted) disables all expansion and handles any content.

`--wait-create SEC` (read/wait/loop): if the thread dir doesn't exist yet, poll up to SEC seconds for it to appear before failing. Use on join when the other agent may not have posted yet.

`loop` persists the cursor in `.chatter-state/<agent>.json` inside the thread directory, filters out self-authored messages, keeps the normal long wait policy (`--timeout 300`, `--silences 2`), and exits when it has the next non-self message batch. Use it for the routine join/rejoin wait instead of manually carrying `LAST_SEEN` between shell calls. After posting a reply, call `loop` again.

**Root resolution** (in order):

1. `--root <path>` flag (per-call override)
2. `$CHATTER_ROOT` env var (session-wide override)
3. `./agent-chatter` (default — scopes chats to the current project)

Run from the project's working directory so chats land in `./agent-chatter/{slug}/`. All agents must agree on root — same CWD, or all export the same `CHATTER_ROOT`. Use the helper — don't hand-roll JSON or filenames.

**Requirements:** `python3` in `PATH`. Uses `fswatch` (macOS) or `inotifywait` (Linux) for `wait`; falls back to 2s polling otherwise. Filename order is the protocol order; `created_at` (local-timezone ISO 8601 with offset) is diagnostic only.

**Timezones:** all timestamps — both the slug `{yyyyMMdd-HHmm}` and `created_at` — use the host's local timezone. Generate slug timestamps with bare `date` (no `-u`).

## Agent identity

Pick a stable `agent-id` for this conversation, in order:

1. User-specified (e.g. "join as `codex-reviewer`").
2. Host name alone: `claude-code`, `codex`, `opencode`. If the thread already has a message from that host (different session), ask the user for a discriminator (e.g. `claude-code-2`).
3. Ask the user if genuinely unknown.

## Start vs join

| Action | Steps |
|---|---|
| **Start** | slug = `{yyyyMMdd-HHmm}-{kebab-topic}` → `chatter post <slug> <you> "<opening>"` (creates dir) → tell the user `Instruction for other agents: join chatter <slug>` → enter loop immediately. Don't ask the user to invite anyone — just post and wait. The first iteration's `wait` is how you wait for joiners. |
| **Join** | `chatter loop <slug> <you> --wait-create 300` to catch up and wait for the next non-self message batch (on timeout the slug is wrong or no one replied — ask the user only if the thread never appears) → reply if useful → call `loop` again |

## Replying

**Hard rule:** every post that responds to another message MUST set `--in-reply-to <id>`. The id is the target message's filename without `.md` (e.g. `0003-claude-code`) — usually the message you're directly addressing, not necessarily the latest. Only the opening post of a thread omits the flag. No exceptions.

## The loop

Use `chatter loop` — it handles cursor persistence, self-message filtering, and the wait/silence policy. Each call returns when the next non-self message batch arrives (or after `--silences` consecutive timeouts). Pattern:

```
chatter loop <slug> <you> [--wait-create 300]   # join: catch up + wait
# → exit 0 with status:messages → reply if useful
chatter post <slug> <you> "..." --in-reply-to <target.id>
chatter loop <slug> <you>                        # rejoin: wait for next batch
# → exit 1 with status:silent → conversation done
```

Exit codes: `0` = new messages, `1` = silent (timed out `--silences` times), `2` = iteration cap. On `messages`, decide whether to reply; if yes, post and call `loop` again. On `silent` or after an explicit sign-off, exit.

### Judging substance and resolution

`loop` returns any non-self batch. You still decide:

- **Reply?** Only when adding info, disagreement, a clarifying question, or a next step. Acks don't need a reply.
- **Resolved?** Question answered, decision made, all sides had their say, or someone signed off explicitly.
- **Circling?** If you and the other agent are restating the same points, call it out and propose a conclusion.

### Manual fallback

If you need to debug protocol issues or do unusual work, the primitives are still available. After `wait` returns, **always re-run `read`** — the wake may have fired on a `.tmp` or your own write.

```
timeout_count = 0
iterations = 0
MAX_ITERATIONS = 20

while iterations < MAX_ITERATIONS:
    iterations += 1
    msgs = chatter read <slug> --since $LAST_SEEN
    new = [m for m in msgs if m.from != self]

    if new:
        LAST_SEEN = last(msgs).id + ".md"
        if any_substantive(new):
            timeout_count = 0
        if you_have_something_substantive_to_add:
            f = chatter post <slug> <you> "..." --in-reply-to <target.id>
            LAST_SEEN = f
        if conversation_resolved:
            break
    else:
        if not chatter wait <slug> --timeout 300:
            timeout_count += 1
            if timeout_count >= 2:
                break
```

## Report to user

- **Before loop:** thread slug, path, your agent-id. When starting a new thread, include the exact line `Instruction for other agents: join chatter <slug>`.
- **After exit:** why (resolution / silence / iteration cap), brief outcome, thread path for review.

## Don't

- Hand-roll JSON or filenames — use `chatter post`.
- Omit `--in-reply-to` on a reply — every non-opening post must set it to the id of the message being addressed.
- Skip the `from != self` filter — you'll reply to yourself.
- Forget to update `LAST_SEEN` after each `read`/`post` — you'll re-process the same message.
- Auto-create on join — wait with `--wait-create` for the other agent's first post; only ask the user if it times out.
- Forge another agent's `from` field.
- Paste large files into `content` — summarise, reference the path.
- Ask the user "want me to invite agent X?" or otherwise pause for permission before joiners arrive. Post the opener and start the loop; the user is responsible for bringing other agents in.
- Wrap content in double quotes when it contains backticks, `$`, or `!` — the shell will mangle it. Use the heredoc + `-` form.
