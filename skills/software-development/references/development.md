# Development (TDD)

## Core Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. **NEVER write production code without a failing test first**
2. One behaviour per test
3. Write minimum code to make the test pass
4. Run affected-submodule tests (whole project if none) before proceeding
5. **New behaviour requires a new test, even when similar existing code lacks one.** Precedent is not permission. Missing twin coverage is a gap to note, not a licence to skip.

## The TDD Cycle

```
🔴 RED    → Write ONE failing test
🟢 GREEN  → Write MINIMUM code to pass
✅ VERIFY → Run affected-submodule tests (or whole project if none), confirm green
🔄 ITERATE → Proceed to the next test 
```

## Detailed Steps

### 🔴 RED — Write ONE Failing Test

1. Identify the next behaviour to implement
2. Write a single test that specifies that behaviour
3. Run the test — it MUST fail
4. If it passes: **your model of the code is wrong.** Investigate before continuing.
5. **When mirroring a precedent (a sibling type, a "just like X" variant), the failing test must exercise the property that makes this *not* X.** Copying the precedent's tests proves the shape matches, not the contract. Ask "what is the one case where this differs from what I'm copying?" — write that. Example: `ZonedDateTime` exists to preserve zone, yet `Instant.compareTo` is instant-total while `ZonedDateTime.compareTo` tiebreaks on zone-ID — a test reusing one zone can't see the difference.

### 🟢 GREEN — Make It Pass

1. Write the simplest code that makes the test pass — but choose appropriate data structures for the domain. A hard-coded value is fine as a first step; a `List` where a `Map` is the natural fit is not simplicity, it's a worse model.
2. Do not refactor yet
3. Run the test — it MUST pass

### ✅ VERIFY — Confirm Green State

Any failing test blocks — do not proceed.

**Public signature changes require eyeballing every caller.** Compile-passing is weak evidence. Some languages coerce between function types — Kotlin accepts `() -> X` where `() -> Unit` is expected (return value dropped); TypeScript's structural typing accepts fewer parameters than the target signature declares — so stale callers stay stale and compile + tests both stay green. After any change to a public function's name, parameter list, or return type: `grep` the old shape, open each hit, confirm the new contract holds at every call site.

**Check the test script before running tests in a non-interactive or background context.** JS monorepos frequently alias `test` → watch mode (`jest --watch`, `vitest`). A test runner with no stdout after 30s is almost always watch mode, not a slow build. Prefer `test:run` / `test:ci`; if pnpm's `--` arg forwarding drops flags, invoke the runner binary directly (e.g. `../../node_modules/.bin/jest <args>` from a package dir).

**Probe local services before invoking tools that depend on them.** Codegen hitting a GraphQL endpoint, migrations hitting a DB, auth flows hitting Keycloak — a one-line port check (`lsof -iTCP:<port> -sTCP:LISTEN`) beats an `ECONNREFUSED` round-trip. Cached schema / fixture files often make the live service optional; prefer those if they exist.

## Red Flags

- "I'll mirror the existing X exactly" — mirroring copies shape, not contract. Find the case where this isn't X, and test that.
